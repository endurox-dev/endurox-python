NAME
----
expyld - Enduro/X Python code to executable linker


SYNOPSIS
--------
*expyld* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*expyld* is Enduro/X Python linker tool. The tool is used to compile given Python
script source files and packages into single executable binary. Python version
supported in 3.6 or later. *expyld* produces single binary executables and for
executable production, C compiler. *expyld* generates C code with embedded
compiled python bytecode and generates startup code which hooks package loader
so that any imports are firstly tested against linked python modules and only
after that fallback to system packages is done.

Linker support embedding of the main module. With the main module, full main
module directory is embedded. Additionally packages to embed are added by the
*-i* (include) flag. Linker does not scan any binaries for any specific includes
to have. All the packages to include must be specified by the hand to the linker
command line.

If package to include has resource files (i.e. extension other than *.py or *.pyc),
error is thrown and linking is stopped, due to fact that inclusion of resource
files for the package are not supported. However ignore flag *-n* can be passed
to the compiler to suppress the exception and continue just with the warning.
However if package loads resource files during the runtime, there might be an
error, as if binary is shipped without installed dependencies on the disk
(which is main purpose of this tool - not to ship/download the
dependencies separately), the resources would not be available.

Package/module resolve principles:

1) Modules from the main directory have higher precedence over the packages.

2) However, if in the script main directory there is module with the same name
as the package in the main directory, then package is loaded, but module not.

3) When including package, which has the module with the same name as the sub-package,
the sub-package is included, but module not.

When loading individual modules, they are linked in following way/order:

1) If source code is available (*.py), it is compiled to the byte code and included
in the binary.

2) If in the package directory there is compiled version of the module (*.pyc),
it is read and included in the binary.

3) If none of above works, cached version (typically from __pycache__) is attempted
to link.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*CC*::
Optional environment variable indicating which C compiler to use. If parameter is
not set, the *cc* command is used.

*CFLAGS*::
Optional C flags to be passed to C compiler during the *buildserver* execution.

*NDRX_HOME*::
Optional Enduro/X home directory, where to search for the *include* sub-folder
and library folder.

OPTIONS
-------

*-m* 'MAIN_MODULE'::
This is filename of the main module.

[*-o* 'OUTPUT_BINARY']::
This is name of output binary.If not specified then *a.out* is used.

[*-i* 'INCLUDE_PKGS']::
List of packages or modules to include in the binary. The include my point to
sub-package. However linker will discover and include __init__.py from any
parent packages automatically. Parameter any be present several times.

[*-n*]::
Ignore resource errors if found.

[*-k*]::
Keep temporary C file on the disk.

[*-h*]::
Print usage.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
Success

*1*::
Failure
